					</hgroup>
					<p>The myth of Adonis was localized and his rites celebrated with much solemnity at two places in Western Asia. One of these was Byblus on the coast of Syria, the other was Paphos in Cyprus. Both were great seats of the worship of Aphrodite, or rather of her Semitic counterpart, Astarte;<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-14" id="noteref-4-1-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and of both, if we accept the legends, Cinyras, the father of Adonis, was king.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-15" id="noteref-4-1-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> Of the two cities Byblus was the more ancient; indeed it claimed to be the oldest city in Phoenicia, and to have been founded in the early ages of the world by the great god El, whom Greeks and Romans identified with Cronus and Saturn respectively.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-16" id="noteref-4-1-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> However that may have been, in historical times it ranked as a holy place, the religious capital of the country, the Mecca or Jerusalem of the Phoenicians.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-17" id="noteref-4-1-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> The city stood on a height beside the sea,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-18" id="noteref-4-1-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> and contained a great sanctuary of Astarte,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-19" id="noteref-4-1-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> where in the midst of a spacious open court, surrounded by cloisters and approached from below by staircases, rose a tall cone or obelisk, the holy image of the goddess.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-20" id="noteref-4-1-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> In this sanctuary the rites of Adonis were celebrated.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-21" id="noteref-4-1-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> Indeed the whole city was sacred to him,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-22" id="noteref-4-1-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> and the river Nahr Ibrahim, which falls into the sea a little to the south of Byblus, bore in antiquity the name of Adonis.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-23" id="noteref-4-1-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> This was the kingdom of Cinyras.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-24" id="noteref-4-1-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> From the earliest to the latest times the city appears to have been ruled by kings, assisted perhaps by a senate or council of elders.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-25" id="noteref-4-1-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a> The first of the kings of whom we have historical evidence was a certain Zekar-baal. He reigned about a century before Solomon; yet from that dim past his figure stands out strangely fresh and lifelike in the journal of an Egyptian merchant or official named Wen-Ammon, which has fortunately been preserved in a papyrus. This man spent some time with the king at Byblus, and received from him, in return for rich presents, a supply of timber felled in the forests of Lebanon.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-26" id="noteref-4-1-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> Another king of Byblus, who bore the name of Sibitti-baal, paid tribute to Tiglath-pileser <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, king of Assyria, about the year 739 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr><a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-27" id="noteref-4-1-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> Further, from an inscription of the fifth or fourth century before our era we learn that a king of Byblus, by name Yehaw-melech, son of Yehar-baal, and grandson of Adom-melech or Uri-melech, dedicated a pillared portico with a carved work of gold and a bronze altar to the goddess, whom he worshipped under the name of Baalath Gebal, that is, the female Baal of Byblus.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-28" id="noteref-4-1-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></p>
					<p>The names of these kings suggest that they claimed affinity with their god Baal or Moloch, for Moloch is only a corruption of <i xml:lang="he-Latn">melech</i>, that is, “king.” Such a claim at all events appears to have been put forward by many other Semitic kings.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-29" id="noteref-4-1-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> The early monarchs of Babylon were worshipped as gods in their lifetime.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-30" id="noteref-4-1-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a> Mesha, king of Moab, perhaps called himself the son of his god Kemosh.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-31" id="noteref-4-1-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a> Among the Aramean sovereigns of Damascus, mentioned in the Bible, we find more than one Ben-hadad, that is, “son of the god Hadad,” the chief male deity of the Syrians;<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-32" id="noteref-4-1-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and Josephus tells us that down to his own time, in the first century of our era, Ben-hadad <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, whom he calls simply Adad, and his successor, Hazael, continued to be worshipped as gods by the people of Damascus, who held processions daily in their honour.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-33" id="noteref-4-1-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> Some of the kings of Edom seem to have gone a step farther and identified themselves with the god in their lifetime; at all events they bore his name Hadad without any qualification.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-34" id="noteref-4-1-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> King Bar-rekub, who reigned over Samal in Northwestern Syria in the time of Tiglath-pileser (745⁠–⁠727 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>) appears from his name to have reckoned himself a son of Rekub-el, the god to whose favour he deemed himself indebted for the kingdom.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-35" id="noteref-4-1-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a> The kings of Tyre traced their descent from Baal,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-36" id="noteref-4-1-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a> and apparently professed to be gods in their own person.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-37" id="noteref-4-1-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> Several of them bore names which are partly composed of the names of Baal and Astarte; one of them bore the name of Baal pure and simple.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-38" id="noteref-4-1-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> The Baal whom they personated was no doubt Melcarth, “the king of the city,” as his name signifies, the great god whom the Greeks identified with Hercules; for the equivalence of the Baal of Tyre both to Melcarth and to Hercules is placed beyond the reach of doubt by a bilingual inscription, in Phoenician and Greek, which was found in Malta.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-39" id="noteref-4-1-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></p>
					<p>In like manner the kings of Byblus may have assumed the style of Adonis; for Adonis was simply the divine Adon or “lord” of the city, a title which hardly differs in sense from Baal (“master”) and Melech (“king”). This conjecture would be confirmed if one of the kings of Byblus actually bore, as Renan believed, the name of Adom-melech, that is, Adonis Melech, the Lord King. But, unfortunately, the reading of the inscription in which the name occurs is doubtful.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-40" id="noteref-4-1-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> Some of the old Canaanite kings of Jerusalem appear to have played the part of Adonis in their lifetime, if we may judge from their names, Adoni-bezek and Adoni-zedek,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-41" id="noteref-4-1-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a> which are divine rather than human titles. Adoni-zedek means “lord of righteousness,” and is therefore equivalent to Melchizedek, that is, “king of righteousness,” the title of that mysterious king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who seems to have been neither more nor less than one of these same Canaanitish kings of Jerusalem.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-42" id="noteref-4-1-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> Thus if the old priestly kings of Jerusalem regularly played the part of Adonis, we need not wonder that in later times the women of Jerusalem used to weep for Tammuz, that is, for Adonis, at the north gate of the temple.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-43" id="noteref-4-1-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> In doing so they may only have been continuing a custom which had been observed in the same place by the Canaanites long before the Hebrews invaded the land. Perhaps the “sacred men,” as they were called, who lodged within the walls of the temple at Jerusalem down almost to the end of the Jewish kingdom,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-44" id="noteref-4-1-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a> may have acted the part of the living Adonis to the living Astarte of the women. At all events we know that in the cells of these strange clergy women wove garments for the <i xml:lang="he-Latn">asherim</i>,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-45" id="noteref-4-1-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a> the sacred poles which stood beside the altar and which appear to have been by some regarded as embodiments of Astarte.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-46" id="noteref-4-1-46" epub:type="noteref">46</a> Certainly these “sacred men” must have discharged some function which was deemed religious in the temple at Jerusalem; and we can hardly doubt that the prohibition to bring the wages of prostitution into the house of God, which was published at the very same time that the men were expelled from the temple,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-47" id="noteref-4-1-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a> was directed against an existing practice. In Palestine as in other Semitic lands the hire of sacred prostitutes was probably dedicated to the deity as one of his regular dues: he took tribute of men and women as of flocks and herds, of fields and vineyards and oliveyards.</p>
					<p>But if Jerusalem had been from of old the seat of a dynasty of spiritual potentates or Grand Lamas, who held the keys of heaven and were revered far and wide as kings and gods in one, we can easily understand why the upstart David chose it for the capital of the new kingdom which he had won for himself at the point of the sword. The central position and the natural strength of the virgin fortress need not have been the only or the principal inducements which decided the politic monarch to transfer his throne from Hebron to Jerusalem.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-48" id="noteref-4-1-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a> By serving himself heir to the ancient kings of the city he might reasonably hope to inherit their ghostly repute along with their broad acres, to wear their nimbus as well as their crown.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-49" id="noteref-4-1-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a> So at a later time when he had conquered Ammon and captured the royal city of Rabbah, he took the heavy gold crown of the Ammonite god Milcom and placed it on his own brows, thus posing as the deity in person.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-50" id="noteref-4-1-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a> It can hardly, therefore, be unreasonable to suppose that he pursued precisely the same policy at the conquest of Jerusalem. And on the other side the calm confidence with which the Jebusite inhabitants of that city awaited his attack, jeering at the besiegers from the battlements,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-51" id="noteref-4-1-51" epub:type="noteref">51</a> may well have been born of a firm trust in the local deity rather than in the height and thickness of their grim old walls. Certainly the obstinacy with which in after ages the Jews defended the same place against the armies of Assyria and Rome sprang in large measure from a similar faith in the God of Zion.</p>
					<p>Be that as it may, the history of the Hebrew kings presents some features which may perhaps, without straining them too far, be interpreted as traces or relics of a time when they or their predecessors played the part of a divinity, and particularly of Adonis, the divine lord of the land. In life the Hebrew king was regularly addressed as <i xml:lang="he-Latn">Adoni-ham-melech</i>, “My Lord the King,”<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-52" id="noteref-4-1-52" epub:type="noteref">52</a> and after death he was lamented with cries of <i xml:lang="he-Latn">Hoi ahi! Hoi Adon!</i> “Alas my brother! alas Lord!”<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-53" id="noteref-4-1-53" epub:type="noteref">53</a> These exclamations of grief uttered for the death of a king of Judah were, we can hardly doubt, the very same cries which the weeping women of Jerusalem uttered in the north porch of the temple for the dead Tammuz.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-54" id="noteref-4-1-54" epub:type="noteref">54</a> However, little stress can be laid on such forms of address, since <i xml:lang="he-Latn">Adon</i> in Hebrew, like “lord” in English, was a secular as well as a religious title. But whether identified with Adonis or not, the Hebrew kings certainly seem to have been regarded as in a sense divine, as representing and to some extent embodying Jehovah on earth. For the king’s throne was called the throne of Jehovah;<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-55" id="noteref-4-1-55" epub:type="noteref">55</a> and the application of the holy oil to his head was believed to impart to him directly a portion of the divine spirit.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-56" id="noteref-4-1-56" epub:type="noteref">56</a> Hence he bore the title of Messiah, which with its Greek equivalent Christ means no more than “the Anointed One.” Thus when David had cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe in the darkness of a cave where he was in hiding, his heart smote him for having laid sacrilegious hands upon <i xml:lang="he-Latn">Adoni Messiah Jehovah</i>, “my Lord the Anointed of Jehovah.”<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-57" id="noteref-4-1-57" epub:type="noteref">57</a></p>
					<p>Like other divine or semi-divine rulers the Hebrew kings were apparently held answerable for famine and pestilence. When a dearth, caused perhaps by a failure of the winter rains, had visited the land for three years, King David inquired of the oracle, which discreetly laid the blame not on him but on his predecessor Saul. The dead king was indeed beyond the reach of punishment, but his sons were not. So David had seven of them sought out, and they were hanged before the Lord at the beginning of barley harvest in spring: and all the long summer the mother of two of the dead men sat under the gallows-tree, keeping off the jackals by night and the vultures by day, till with the autumn the blessed rain came at last to wet their dangling bodies and fertilize the barren earth once more. Then the bones of the dead were taken down from the gibbet and buried in the sepulchre of their fathers.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-58" id="noteref-4-1-58" epub:type="noteref">58</a> The season when these princes were put to death, at the beginning of barley harvest, and the length of time they hung on the gallows, seem to show that their execution was not a mere punishment, but that it partook of the nature of a rain-charm. For it is a common belief that rain can be procured by magical ceremonies performed with dead men’s bones,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-59" id="noteref-4-1-59" epub:type="noteref">59</a> and it would be natural to ascribe a special virtue in this respect to the bones of princes, who are often expected to give rain in their life. When the Israelites demanded of Samuel that he should give them a king, the indignant prophet, loth to be superseded by the upstart Saul, called on the Lord to send thunder and rain, and the Lord did so at once, though the season was early summer and the reapers were at work in the wheat-fields, a time when in common years no rain falls from the cloudless Syrian sky.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-60" id="noteref-4-1-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a> The pious historian who records the miracle seems to have regarded it as a mere token of the wrath of the deity, whose voice was heard in the roll of thunder; but we may surmise that in giving this impressive proof of his control of the weather Samuel meant to hint gently at the naughtiness of asking for a king to do for the fertility of the land what could be done quite as well and far more cheaply by a prophet.</p>
					<p>In Israel the excess as well as the deficiency of rain seems to have been set down to the wrath of the deity.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-61" id="noteref-4-1-61" epub:type="noteref">61</a> When the Jews returned to Jerusalem from the great captivity and assembled for the first time in the square before the ruined temple, it happened that the weather was very wet, and as the people sat shelterless and drenched in the piazza they trembled at their sin and at the rain.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-62" id="noteref-4-1-62" epub:type="noteref">62</a> In all ages it has been the strength or the weakness of Israel to read the hand of God in the changing aspects of nature, and we need not wonder that at such a time and in so dismal a scene, with a lowering sky overhead, the blackened ruins of the temple before their eyes, and the steady drip of the rain over all, the returned exiles should have been oppressed with a double sense of their own guilt and of the divine anger. Perhaps, though they hardly knew it, memories of the bright sun, fat fields, and broad willow-fringed rivers of Babylon,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-63" id="noteref-4-1-63" epub:type="noteref">63</a> which had been so long their home, lent a deeper shade of sadness to the austerity of the Judean landscape, with its gaunt grey hills stretching away, range beyond range, to the horizon, or dipping eastward to the far line of sombre blue which marks the sullen waters of the Dead Sea.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-64" id="noteref-4-1-64" epub:type="noteref">64</a></p>
					<p>In the days of the Hebrew monarchy the king was apparently credited with the power of making sick and making whole. Thus the king of Syria sent a leper to the king of Israel to be healed by him, just as scrofulous patients used to fancy that they could be cured by the touch of a French or English king. However, the Hebrew monarch, with more sense than has been shown by his royal brothers in modern times, professed himself unable to work any such miracle. “Am I God,” he asked, “to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?”<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-65" id="noteref-4-1-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a> On another occasion, when pestilence ravaged the country and the excited fancy of the plague-stricken people saw in the clouds the figure of the Destroying Angel with his sword stretched out over Jerusalem, they laid the blame on King David, who had offended the touchy and irascible deity by taking a census. The prudent monarch bowed to the popular storm, acknowledged his guilt, and appeased the angry god by offering burnt sacrifices on the threshing-floor of Araunah, one of the old Jebusite inhabitants of Jerusalem. Then the angel sheathed his flashing sword, and the shrieks of the dying and the lamentations for the dead no longer resounded in the streets.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-66" id="noteref-4-1-66" epub:type="noteref">66</a></p>
					<p>To this theory of the sanctity, nay the divinity of the Hebrew kings it may be objected that few traces of it survive in the historical books of the Bible. But the force of the objection is weakened by a consideration of the time and the circumstances in which these books assumed their final shape. The great prophets of the eighth and the seventh centuries by the spiritual ideals and the ethical fervour of their teaching had wrought a religious and moral reform perhaps unparalleled in history. Under their influence an austere monotheism had replaced the old sensuous worship of the natural powers: a stern Puritanical spirit, an unbending rigour of mind, had succeeded to the old easy supple temper with its weak compliances, its wax-like impressionability, its proclivities to the sins of the flesh. And the moral lessons which the prophets inculcated were driven home by the political events of the time, above all by the ever-growing pressure of the great Assyrian empire on the petty states of Palestine. The long agony of the siege of Samaria<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-67" id="noteref-4-1-67" epub:type="noteref">67</a> must have been followed with trembling anxiety by the inhabitants of Judea, for the danger was at their door. They had only to lift up their eyes and look north to see the blue hills of Ephraim, at whose foot lay the beleaguered city. Its final fall and the destruction of the northern kingdom could not fail to fill every thoughtful mind in the sister realm with sad forebodings. It was as if the sky had lowered and thunder muttered over Jerusalem. Thenceforth to the close of the Jewish monarchy, about a century and a half later, the cloud never passed away, though once for a little it seemed to lift, when Sennacherib raised the siege of Jerusalem<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-68" id="noteref-4-1-68" epub:type="noteref">68</a> and the watchers on the walls beheld the last of the long line of spears and standards disappearing, the last squadron of the blue-coated Assyrian cavalry sweeping, in a cloud of dust, out of sight.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-69" id="noteref-4-1-69" epub:type="noteref">69</a></p>
					<p>It was in this period of national gloom and despondency that the two great reformations of Israel’s religion were accomplished, the first by king Hezekiah, the second a century later by king Josiah.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-70" id="noteref-4-1-70" epub:type="noteref">70</a> We need not wonder then that the reformers who in that and subsequent ages composed or edited the annals of their nation should have looked as sourly on the old unreformed paganism of their forefathers as the fierce zealots of the Commonwealth looked on the far more innocent pastimes of Merry England; and that in their zeal for the glory of God they should have blotted many pages of history lest they should perpetuate the memory of practices to which they traced the calamities of their country. All the historical books passed through the office of the Puritan censor,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-71" id="noteref-4-1-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a> and we can hardly doubt that they emerged from it stript of many gay feathers which they had flaunted when they went in. Among the shed plumage may well have been the passages which invested human beings, whether kings or commoners, with the attributes of deity. Certainly no pages could seem to the censor more rankly blasphemous; on none, therefore, was he likely to press more firmly the official sponge.</p>
					<p>But if Semitic kings in general and the kings of Byblus in particular often assumed the style of Baal or Adonis, it follows that they may have mated with the goddess, the Baalath or Astarte of the city. Certainly we hear of kings of Tyre and Sidon who were priests of Astarte.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-72" id="noteref-4-1-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a> Now to the agricultural Semites the Baal or god of a land was the author of all its fertility; he it was who produced the corn, the wine, the figs, the oil, and the flax, by means of his quickening waters, which in the arid parts of the Semitic world are oftener springs, streams, and underground flow than the rains of heaven.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-73" id="noteref-4-1-73" epub:type="noteref">73</a> Further, “the life-giving power of the god was not limited to vegetative nature, but to him also was ascribed the increase of animal life, the multiplication of flocks and herds, and, not least, of the human inhabitants of the land. For the increase of animate nature is obviously conditioned, in the last resort, by the fertility of the soil, and primitive races, which have not learned to differentiate the various kinds of life with precision, think of animate as well as vegetable life as rooted in the earth and sprung from it. The earth is the great mother of all things in most mythological philosophies, and the comparison of the life of mankind, or of a stock of men, with the life of a tree, which is so common in Semitic as in other primitive poetry, is not in its origin a mere figure. Thus where the growth of vegetation is ascribed to a particular divine power, the same power receives the thanks and homage of his worshippers for the increase of cattle and of men. Firstlings as well as first-fruits were offered at the shrines of the Baalim, and one of the commonest classes of personal names given by parents to their sons or daughters designates the child as the gift of the god.” In short, “the Baal was conceived as the male principle of reproduction, the husband of the land which he fertilised.”<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-74" id="noteref-4-1-74" epub:type="noteref">74</a> So far, therefore, as the Semite personified the reproductive energies of nature as male and female, as a Baal and a Baalath, he appears to have identified the male power especially with water and the female especially with earth. On this view plants and trees, animals and men, are the offspring or children of the Baal and Baalath.</p>
					<p>If, then, at Byblus and elsewhere, the Semitic king was allowed, or rather required, to personate the god and marry the goddess, the intention of the custom can only have been to ensure the fertility of the land and the increase of men and cattle by means of homoeopathic magic. There is reason to think that a similar custom was observed from a similar motive in other parts of the ancient world, and particularly at Nemi, where both the male and the female powers, the Dianus and Diana, were in one aspect of their nature personifications of the life-giving waters.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-75" id="noteref-4-1-75" epub:type="noteref">75</a></p>
					<p>The last king of Byblus bore the ancient name of Cinyras, and was beheaded by Pompey the Great for his tyrannous excesses.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-76" id="noteref-4-1-76" epub:type="noteref">76</a> His legendary namesake Cinyras is said to have founded a sanctuary of Aphrodite, that is, of Astarte, at a place on Mount Lebanon, distant a day’s journey from the capital.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-77" id="noteref-4-1-77" epub:type="noteref">77</a> The spot was probably Aphaca, at the source of the river Adonis, halfway between Byblus and Baalbec; for at Aphaca there was a famous grove and sanctuary of Astarte which Constantine destroyed on account of the flagitious character of the worship.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-78" id="noteref-4-1-78" epub:type="noteref">78</a> The site of the temple has been discovered by modern travellers near the miserable village which still bears the name of Afka at the head of the wild, romantic, wooded gorge of the Adonis. The hamlet stands among groves of noble walnut-trees on the brink of the lyn. A little way off the river rushes from a cavern at the foot of a mighty amphitheatre of towering cliffs to plunge in a series of cascades into the awful depths of the glen. The deeper it descends, the ranker and denser grows the vegetation, which, sprouting from the crannies and fissures of the rocks, spreads a green veil over the roaring or murmuring stream in the tremendous chasm below. There is something delicious, almost intoxicating, in the freshness of these tumbling waters, in the sweetness and purity of the mountain air, in the vivid green of the vegetation. The temple, of which some massive hewn blocks and a fine column of Syenite granite still mark the site, occupied a terrace facing the source of the river and commanding a magnificent prospect. Across the foam and the roar of the waterfalls you look up to the cavern and away to the top of the sublime precipices above. So lofty is the cliff that the goats which creep along its ledges to browse on the bushes appear like ants to the spectator hundreds of feet below. Seaward the view is especially impressive when the sun floods the profound gorge with golden light, revealing all the fantastic buttresses and rounded towers of its mountain rampart, and falling softly on the varied green of the woods which clothe its depths.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-79" id="noteref-4-1-79" epub:type="noteref">79</a> It was here that, according to the legend, Adonis met Aphrodite for the first or the last time,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-80" id="noteref-4-1-80" epub:type="noteref">80</a> and here his mangled body was buried.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-81" id="noteref-4-1-81" epub:type="noteref">81</a> A fairer scene could hardly be imagined for a story of tragic love and death. Yet, sequestered as the valley is and must always have been, it is not wholly deserted. A convent or a village may be observed here and there standing out against the sky on the top of some beetling crag, or clinging to the face of a nearly perpendicular cliff high above the foam and the din of the river; and at evening the lights that twinkle through the gloom betray the presence of human habitations on slopes which might seem inaccessible to man. In antiquity the whole of the lovely vale appears have been dedicated to Adonis, and to this day it is haunted by his memory; for the heights which shut it in are crested at various points by ruined monuments of his worship, some of them overhanging dreadful abysses, down which it turns the head dizzy to look and see the eagles wheeling about their nests far below. One such monument exists at Ghineh. The face of a great rock, above a roughly hewn recess, is here carved with figures of Adonis and Aphrodite. He is portrayed with spear in rest, awaiting the attack of a bear, while she is seated in an attitude of sorrow.<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-82" id="noteref-4-1-82" epub:type="noteref">82</a> Her grief-stricken figure may well be the mourning Aphrodite of the Lebanon described by Macrobius,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-83" id="noteref-4-1-83" epub:type="noteref">83</a> and the recess in the rock is perhaps her lover’s tomb. Every year, in the belief of his worshippers, Adonis was wounded to death on the mountains, and every year the face of nature itself was dyed with his sacred blood. So year by year the Syrian damsels lamented his untimely fate,<a href="endnotes-4-1.xhtml#note-4-1-84" id="noteref-4-1-84" epub:type="noteref">84</a> while the red anemone, his flower, bloomed among the cedars of Lebanon, and the river ran red to the sea, fringing the winding shores of the blue Mediterranean, whenever the wind set inshore, with a sinuous, band of crimson.</p>
