			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface to the Second Edition</h2>
			<p>In this second edition some minor corrections have been made and some fresh matter added. Where my views appear to have been misunderstood, I have endeavoured to state them more clearly; where they have been disputed, I have carefully reconsidered the evidence and given my reasons for adhering to my former opinions. Most of the additions thus made to the volume are comprised in a new chapter (<span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Men and Women”</span>), a new section (<span class="tei tei-q">“Influence of Mother-kin on Religion”</span>), and three new appendices (<span class="tei tei-q">“Moloch the King,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Widowed Flamen,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Some Customs of the Pelew Islanders”</span>). Among the friends and correspondents who have kindly helped me with information and criticisms of various sorts I wish to thank particularly Mr. W. Crooke, Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie, Mr. G. F. Hill of the British Museum, the Reverend J. Roscoe of the Church Missionary Society, and Mr. W. Wyse. Above all I owe much to my teacher the Reverend Professor R. H. Kennett, who, besides initiating me into the charms of the Hebrew language and giving me a clearer insight into the course of Hebrew history, has contributed several valuable suggestions to the book and enhanced the kindness by reading and criticizing some of the proofs.</p>
